PicoCalc — Quick Reference
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Three sets of tools are installed. Each has a README in its folder.

  ~/ai/       Claude AI tools (ask, chat, explain, commit-msg)
  ~/dev/      Dev & system helpers (note, search, backlight, serve, battery)
  ~/gaming/   Game launchers (pico8, pygame scripts, SDL2 wrapper)

All scripts are also on PATH via ~/bin/. Type the command name from anywhere.
